## Getting Started

Install `@guidepup/playwright` to your project:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @guidepup/playwright
```

And get cracking with your first screen-reader tests in Playwright! ðŸš€

```ts
import { voTest as test } from "@guidepup/playwright";
import { expect } from "@playwright/test";

test.describe("Playwright VoiceOver", () => {
  test("I can navigate the Playwright website using VoiceOver", async ({
    page,
    vo,
  }) => {
    // Navigate to Playwright website ðŸŽ‰
    await page.goto("https://playwright.dev/", {
      waitUntil: "domcontentloaded",
    });

    // Interact with the page ðŸ™Œ
    await vo.commandInteractWithItem();

    // Move across the navigation menu to the search bar using VoiceOver ðŸ”Ž
    while (!(await vo.getLastSpokenPhrase())?.startsWith("Search")) {
      await vo.moveNext();
    }

    // Search for Safari ðŸ‘€
    await page.keyboard.type("Safari");
    await vo.performAction();
    expect(page.url()).toBe("https://playwright.dev/docs/browsers#webkit");
  });
});
```

## Playwright Config

In your `playwright.config.ts` add the following for the best results with
Guidepup for VoiceOver automation. ðŸ’¥

```ts
import { devices, PlaywrightTestConfig } from "@playwright/test";
import { voConfig } from "@guidepup/playwright";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  ...voConfig,
  
  // Your custom config ...
};

export default config;
```

Check out the configuration this adds [here](./src/voConfig.ts). ðŸ‘€
